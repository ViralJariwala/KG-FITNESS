At KG Fitness, Group EX consists of members coming together in classes led by experienced, certified instructors. We have created programs where exercise and music are put together in a structured manner. This ensures a safe and fun filled way of working out. Group EX is usually a one hour program conducted 6 days a week, at various time during the day which gives flexibility to members to choose the time of their convenience. We have the kickboxing, poweryoga, bootcamps, combat training and many more.</span></span></p>
